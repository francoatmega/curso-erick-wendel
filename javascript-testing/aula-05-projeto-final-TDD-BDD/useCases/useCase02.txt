## Use Case 02

As a system user

In order to calculate the final renting price

Given a customer who wants to rent a car for 5 days

And he is 50 years old

When he chooses a car category that costs $37.6 per day

Then I must add the Tax of his age which is 30% to the car category price

Then the final formula will be `((price per day * Tax) * number of days)`

And the final result will be `((37.6 * 1.3) * 5)= 244.4`

And the final price will be printed in Brazilian Portuguese format as "R$ 244,40"
