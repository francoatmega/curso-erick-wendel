## Use Case 03

As a system user

In order to register a renting transaction

Given a registered customer who is 50 years old

And a car model that costs $37.6 per day

And a delivery date that is for 05 days behind

And given an actual date 05/11/2020

When I rent a car I should see the customer data

And the car selected

And the final price which will be R$ 244,40

And DueDate which will be printed in Brazilian Portuguese format "10 de Novembro de 2020"
